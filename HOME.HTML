  <br><br><h1>TRANSFER MARKET 2021</h1>
  <p>The transfer market is the arena in which football players are available for transfer to clubs.<BR>
The transfer market consists of a list of players available for transfer, and also the money moving between clubs as they contest to purchase and sell these players.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>* TRANSFER LIST :</h2>
  <p>If a player is "put on the transfer list", the club which owns the player has indicated his availability.<br> Other clubs are then able to approach the owning club to bid for the player in an attempt to sign him. <br>Though clubs can approach other clubs to put in a bid for a player, they know that a player on the 'transfer list' can be purchased for a more reasonable price as the club are willing to sell the player.</p>
 <br>
 <h2>* TRANSFER REQUEST :</h2>
  <P>Transfer request
A player may make a "transfer request," to leave their club before the end of their contract. <BR>In this case, the player is publicly stating his desire to move, and encouraging other clubs to make an offer for him.<BR> Due to the public nature of transfer requests, they are often used by players to air their grievances, such as frustration over contract negotiations or a clash of personality with the manager. <BR>A player may remove their request if the source of unhappiness is resolved.<BR>The club can also reject a transfer request,effectively stating their intention to reject any offer for that player.</P>
<br>
<h2>* BIDDING :</h2>
<P>So once a player has been identified, the next step is the transfer (or loan) offer. <BR>Pretty straightforward, you’d think, but there is more than one way to start a transfer.<BR>
The most obvious is for a buying club to submit a formal written offer for a player, seemingly by fax even in this day and age, which will then be considered by the selling club.<BR>
But it is just as common for clubs to contact trusted agents to act on their behalf, either in finding an available player from another club, or finding a buyer for their own unwanted player.<BR>These agents act as intermediaries between the buyers and the sellers, and can set the wheels in motion for a deal that otherwise may not have been struck.</P>
<br>
<h2>* NEGOTIATION :</h2>
<P>For those of us in the media, transfer stories provide stock phrases, which are almost becoming cliches. “Preliminary talks,” “advanced discussions”, “talks ongoing”, “personal terms”, “showdown talks” - the list is growing.<BR>Such phrases evoke images of a group of people – players, agents, chairmen, managers – sat around a table sliding pieces of paper with figures on them to each other, to be greeted by a shake of the head and an ‘add a nought on to that and come back, matey.’<BR>Again, the reality is very different.<BR>
‘Negotiation’ meetings are often brief, with an agent laying out a player’s demands, and an official (usually the chief executive, the head of recruitment or the director of football) giving the club’s side of things.<BR>Issues which arise during negotiations often relate to, of course, salary, bonuses and signing-on fees, as well as personal and social considerations.
<BR>Players often leave the negotiations to their agents, and are kept abreast of the situation from afar. They usually meet with a manager before a deal goes through to discuss how he would fit in at his potential new club - and if they don’t, then they’re taking a huge risk - but in terms of sitting round a negotiating table discussing figures? Rarely.</P>
<br>
<h2>* MEDICAL:</h2>
<P>The final hurdles in a deal are the medical and, for some players, the work permit.<BR> Medicals at top-level clubs are stringent, carried out at the training ground – Liverpool also carry out tests on players at the Spire Hospital in Mossley Hill - and often well publicised through club’s official media channels.<BR>But as time ticks away on deadline day clubs, naturally, have been known to take gambles.<BR> Liverpool, for example, signed Andy Carroll in January 2011 while the striker was sidelined with a thigh injury. Basically, if both club and player want a deal to go through, then it will.</P>
<br>
<h2>* HERE WE GO :</h2>
<P>And there you have it.
The fee is agreed, the personal terms are agreed, the medical is done.<BR> All that remains is to lodge the signed and sealed, finalised paperwork with the  League and , and to make sure you get the obligatory smiling photo of the player with his new manager, and his new club’s shirt.
Simple, eh.</P><br>
